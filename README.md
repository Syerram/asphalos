# Asphalos: Greek for secured

I am paranoid when it comes to storing passwords online. In fact I don't want the passwords to be stored on cloud. The app stores everything locally and doesn't use any external service to store, cloud backup or any of the HTTP shannigans.

The app was also an attempt to learn Swift language. Swift introduced new concepts over its legacy counterpart Obj-C, like extensions, better enums, protocols, generics and so on. 
The app is extremely simple but if you look at the code, I have tried to leverage every aspect of the language features (especially extensions and generics) and also biometric fingerprinting for authentication.

Learning is boring but learning with a project is extremely fun. Shot out to Ray Wenderlich for excellent tutorials.
